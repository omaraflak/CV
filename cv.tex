    \experience{Dec 2021}{\textit{present}}{Google}{Software Engineer}{London, UK}{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Building Gemini-based AI agents that interact with devices through UI to complete a given task. Finetuned custom models to resolve referring expressions into bounding boxes on screen. Built evaluation pipelines for agents.
            \item Prototyped and wrote designs for a RAG pipeline to index app contents. Project raised \$30M and aims at indexing 1B app pages/day. Allocated engineers on project.
            \item Designed and implemented end-to-end patching feature for Android Deep Links, involving: modifications in GmsCore, implementation of a storage solution, development of data pipelines, creation of APIs, and the design of a web UI in Play Console.
            \item Launched the \link{https://play.google.com/console/about/deeplinks}{Deep Links} page in Play Console. Developed several critical, time sensitive data pipelines responsible for processing data coming from 1.4B Android devices daily. Project led to the fix of ~20\% of App Links domains. Increased a stream of revenue by \$xxM.

    \experience{Feb 2021}{Aug 2021}{Criteo}{Software Engineer}{Paris, FR}{
        Redesigned from scratch, in PySpark, the pipeline that prepares data for training Criteo's machine learning models for Ads. The pipeline handles multi-terabytes of data daily. Improved processing time, -300\% on memory usage, -125\% on computation power, simpler code, and replaced old Scala codebase with Python.
        Developed a highly optimized C\# code that transforms data for realtime inference. Reduced overall prediction time by 3\%.

    \project{2024}{CUDA Tensor library}{
        A tensor library developed from scratch, with a module for training neural networks. Tensor operations run in C or CUDA. The library has Python bindings for ease of use: \link{https://github.com/omaraflak/pynn}{Pynn}.

    \newsectionspace
    \project{2023}{Programming language}{
        A programming language developed from scratch in C++. Despite the funky name I gave it, the \link{https://github.com/omaraflak/banana}{Banana programming language} has a scanner, parser, compiler, and a virtual machine.

    \project{2022}{EIP-4671: Non-Tradable Tokens}{
        \link{https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4671}{EIP-4671} is protocol I designed for Non-Tradable Tokens on the Ethereum blockhain.

    \project{2021}{YouTube Channel}{
        After writing articles for many years, I decided to change my medium of expression. I started a YouTube channel February 2021 where I program mathematical concepts, such as neural networks, from scratch. \link{https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1OLIHvAKBQy3o5LcbbxUSg}{The Independent Code}.

    \project{2020}{King Of Ether}{
        King of Ether is an existing game that I reimplemented on the blockhain of Ethereum using Solidity smart contracts. The game is a Ponzi scheme in itself. To start the game, a player has to send ETH to the contract and becomes the so called "king". Then, every person that wants to claim the throne must send 30\% more ETH to the contract and will become the new king. When this happens, the ETH of the new king are transfered to the account of the old king. And so on... If nobody claims the throne for 7 days in a row, the game ends, and the current king is dethroned and loses his ETH... \link{https://kingofether.github.io}{https://kingofether.github.io}.

    \project{2019}{Leaf}{
        Leaf is a device with radio capabilities that can be plugged directly into a smartphone. People using Leaf form a \textbf{mesh network} that allows them to communicate over long distances (up to \textbf{3 km} between each node, and by jumping through nodes for longer distances) without any internet connection. This personal project was a proof of concept to demonstrate possible alternatives for private decentralized communications. \link{https://medium.com/@martin.marvin/leaf-project-natural-disaster-communication-system-1d73e8eaa7b8}{Leaf Project — Natural disaster communication system}.

    \project{2018}{Machine Learning Library from scratch}{
        In 2017, I decided to learn AI and more specifically the in-and-out of neural networks. I taught myself by reading on the internet, and managed to get a strong understanding of how neural networks work, both mathematically and programmatically. I developed a machine learning library akin Keras \link{https://github.com/omaraflak/my-neural-nets}{on GitHub}. I wrote an article \link{https://towardsdatascience.com/math-neural-network-from-scratch-in-python-d6da9f29ce65?source=friends_link&sk=2776d172d7666cc74c6b0ed292a91b0b}{on Medium} that got published in \textbf{\textit{Towards Data Science}}, and gave a talk/lesson within the organization \textbf{\textit{School Of AI}} in Paris.
